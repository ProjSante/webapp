> We believe that is an improvement to make concerning the patients that are wainting in an ER facility.

This is a webapp for the [Follow.ER](https://projsante.herokuapp.com/) project. It is a safe platform that can be used by ER facilities to manage patients's vital signs.

## Features
It can:

- Safelly interact with users (ER facilities)
- Admit, update and discharge patients
- Receive patient's vital signs and update his or her information on a database
- Displays ER and patient information through an interface
- Work as a standalone application or it can be integrated on any suite through API requests
